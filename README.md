## Tech Stack

### Backend:
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Used for building a RESTful API that connects the frontend and backend.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database used for storing user data and notes.

### Frontend:
- **AngularJS**: A JavaScript framework for building dynamic single-page applications (SPA).

### Containerization (Optional):
- **Docker**: Docker is used to containerize both the frontend and backend services, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments.

### Other Technologies:
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured in the backend for secure communication between the frontend and backend when they are hosted on different domains.
- **GitHub**: GitHub is used for version control, managing code, and collaboration.
